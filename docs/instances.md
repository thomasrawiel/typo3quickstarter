# Managing your instances

`--list` and `--cleanup` both scan a directory (current directory, or `--path=DIR`) for instances this script created. They recognize an instance by the marker files it writes — `.ddev/config.yaml` plus either `.ddev/.typo3-ddev-setup-marker` or `typo3-credentials.txt` in the project folder — not by the folder name. So instances started with a custom `--name=` are found just as reliably as auto-generated ones.

`.ddev/.typo3-ddev-setup-marker` is written right after `ddev config`, before anything that could still fail (Composer, the TYPO3 setup itself, ...) - `typo3-credentials.txt` alone only proves a run finished successfully, so without it a run that died partway would leave a DDEV project neither command could find or remove. It sits inside `.ddev/` because `ddev composer create-project` only runs on a project directory that is empty apart from a small whitelist, and `.ddev/` is one of the few directories it ignores. Instances created with 0.4.0, which wrote the marker to the project root, are still recognized.

The TYPO3 version shown is read straight out of each instance's `composer.lock` (the exact `typo3/cms-core` version), not just the major version encoded in the folder name.

## `--list`: see what's there

```bash
./typo3-ddev-setup.sh --list
```

```
TYPO3 V12.4.45    typo3-v12-284           https://typo3-v12-284.ddev.site
TYPO3 V13.4.1     typo3-v13-6235           https://typo3-v13-6235.ddev.site
```

Non-interactive, plain output — safe to run in scripts or CI. Prints nothing to delete or select, just what's currently on disk under the scanned path.

## `--cleanup`: get rid of it

```bash
./typo3-ddev-setup.sh --cleanup
```

`--clear` and `--c` are exact aliases for `--cleanup`, in case that's easier to remember or type.

If there's only one instance, there's nothing to pick from — it just asks you to confirm removing that one:

```
Found: TYPO3 V12.4.45 | typo3-v12-284
Are you sure you want to remove it? [y/N]
```

With more than one, you get an interactive checklist instead:

```
Select instances to delete (Up/Down move, Space toggle, Enter confirm, q abort):
> [ ] TYPO3 V12.4.45 | typo3-v12-284
  [x] TYPO3 V13.4.1  | typo3-v13-6235
```

- `↑` / `↓` — move
- `Space` — toggle selection
- `Enter` — confirm the selection
- `q` — abort, nothing is touched

Confirming the selection doesn't delete anything right away — it lists exactly what you picked and asks once more:

```
Are you sure you want to remove the following instances?
  - typo3-v12-284
  - typo3-v13-6235
Proceed? [y/N]
```

Only on `y`/`yes` does it actually run `ddev delete -Oy` for each one (removes containers, DB volumes, the DDEV project listing, and the hosts file entry) and only deletes the project folder itself once that succeeded — if `ddev delete` fails for some reason, the folder is left in place so nothing gets silently lost.

`--cleanup` needs an interactive terminal (arrow keys / space / enter) — it won't run in a non-interactive shell or CI. Use `--list` there instead.

### Extra guard for version-controlled work

Right before actually deleting an instance (any of the paths above - single, checklist, or `--c all`), it's checked for a `.git` directory anywhere inside it - most commonly `packages/<extension>/.git` from [`--with-git`](with-git.md), but this catches any `.git` found in there, not just ones this script created. If one's found, deleting stops for a stronger, separate confirmation:

```
WARNING: found a .git directory inside typo3-v12-284 - there's version-controlled work in there that would be permanently lost.
Type 'yes' (not just 'y') to delete typo3-v12-284 anyway - this cannot be undone:
```

Unlike every other confirmation in this script, a bare `y` does not count here - only the word `yes` written out in full does (case-insensitive: `yes`/`Yes`/`YES`). Anything else, including a bare `y` or `Y`, skips just that instance and leaves it in place; the rest of the batch (if there is one) is unaffected.

## Targeting a specific instance

Every "Done" summary prints a ready-to-use cleanup command for the instance you just created:

```
To clean up this instance: ./typo3-ddev-setup.sh --c 284
```

`--c`/`--clear`/`--cleanup` can take one or more name/ID substrings, space-separated (same multi-value syntax as `--require`/`--extension`). Only instances whose name contains at least one of them are considered:

```bash
./typo3-ddev-setup.sh --c 284
```

For an auto-generated name like `typo3-v12-284`, the three-digit suffix alone is enough and is what the hint prints. Those digits are picked so they don't collide: a candidate is only used if no folder and no DDEV project of that name exists yet — DDEV project names are global, so an instance created in a completely different directory counts too. For a custom `--name=`, there's no separate suffix, so the hint prints the full name instead.

If the filter narrows things down to exactly one instance, it skips straight to the single-instance confirmation (`Found: ... Are you sure you want to remove it?`); with more than one match it still shows the checklist, just restricted to those. No match prints `No instance matching <target> found in '<path>'.` instead of the usual empty-scan message.

## Removing everything: `--c all`

```bash
./typo3-ddev-setup.sh --c all
```

`all` is a special target, not a name/ID substring - used on its own it means every instance found under `--path`. Skips the checklist entirely and goes straight to one confirmation listing all of them:

```
Are you sure you want to remove ALL of the following instances?
  - TYPO3 V12.4.45 | typo3-v12-284
  - TYPO3 V13.4.1  | typo3-v13-6235
Proceed? [y/N]
```

Same `y`/`yes`-only deletion behavior as above - nothing is touched until you confirm, and each instance is only removed from disk once `ddev delete` succeeds for it. Only works when `all` is the sole target; `--c all 284` is treated as two literal substrings instead (neither of which is likely to match anything named `all`), not as a shortcut for "everything".
